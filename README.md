!!!! Important !!!!
===================

There is now a fork of PEG.js, called [Peggy](https://peggyjs.org/), that is actively maintained. I suggest migrating there (Peggy version 1.x.x is fully compatible to the latest PEG.js version).

They also provide a fork of this extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeggyJS.peggy-language) with additional features like:
- Goto Definition
- Find Usages
- Rule name completion
- Rename Symbol
- Outline

Please check it out!

This extension will stay as it is, continuing to provide support for the latest PEG.js version, but no further development is planned.
